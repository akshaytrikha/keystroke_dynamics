# Keystroke Dynamics

Using the (mostly) unique rhythym in which people type to distinguish them for authentication. Used a simple decision tree model. Here's the [dataset](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~keystroke/) I got inspiration from and here are some of my feature visalizations. The accuracy was around 80-90% but I think the model might have been overfitting.
